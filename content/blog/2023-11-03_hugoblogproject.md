I decided to create a blog website hosted by Github pages.
The main goal here is to keep myself accountable for tasks that I am performing.
I often find myself going down tangents and losing my end-goal focus.

A bit of a disclaimer: i'm in no way a developer, I have no formal education in any related fields.
I will go on further into this with another post down the track.

My reasons for using Hugo was a lot of inspiration from [Luke Smith](https://www.youtube.com/@LukeSmithxyz).
I have dabbled previously in some HTML/CSS, but very minimally.
I found that the simple method of using markdown files to create posts, means it's super easy for me to write a post on-the-go (mobile, etc.) and later transfer that to my machine and update the Github repo where this lives.

As I further develop my skills here and play around with my own themes and settings, I would like to provide an update with what I have been doing and the reasonings behind it all.

## Upcoming Projects

I have a few projects in the pipeline that I am using to help develop my own skills.
