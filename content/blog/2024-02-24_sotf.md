# Sons of the Forest

Wednesday 21st Feb, I purchased Sons of the Forest (SotF). I have a couple of friends that are looking at getting back into the game after it's recent full-release update.
I have never played the original, nor have I watched much content.

I've just started playing a single-player world to play around with, learn the control, see how the game works to an extent, while I wait for us to all come online at the same time to start a co-operative save.

So far I am really impressed with the game. It's been a while since I've played a survival craft game, but I can't recall ever playing one that made me feel the way I do playing SotF.

## First World

Crash landing into the forest spawn, I managed to fiddle my way through the controls. That was exactly what this 'First World' was designed to be for myself.
A way to learn the controls, and the basics of the game, prior to jumping into a multiplayer server with some friends.

My plan was never to go to deep, but well... you get attached to characters and bases sometimes.

So I ventured not too far from the helicopter crash site, to a small lake where a few streams adjoined.

I started building a small house from the templates, went on to crafting a few storage stations and fencing off a portion of the property.

*7 days, 20 hours*. 

## Multiplayer

It was shortly after the end of my First World, that I played multiplayer with a friend. We made quick progress gaining the modern axe, machete, pistol and zipline gun.
These were the main starting items that would make general gameplay a fair bit easier going forward before really delving too much into the story.

## Main World

So without too much success on my first world, and with a lot of learning's, it was time to create a new world where I would aim to complete the campaign and truly experience SotF.


I managed the same start, had the forest spawn, but with a little more of an idea on what a good start looks like, I quickly repeated most of my multiplayer findings to get back to where we left off. After doing so, I made my way to a lake on the eastern side of the map.
It seemed like a good spot for a base, nice and open, but still with plenty of resources around. There was also a small island off toward the middle of the lake which seemed like a potential spot for a late game base due to the protection it granted.
Here's an aerial view of my original base as seen from a glider.

I quickly decided that being woken up in the middle of the night due to nearby enemies was not something I was super interested in.
In fact, that is the main reason for me dying so quickly in my First World.

So as my first winter in the game came upon me quickly, I decided that was a great time to make my way over to the island and make use of the log carts to quickly move resources across (this was prior to finding the zipline in this particular playthrough).
Eventually finding the zipline and as spring fell, I made a few transportation lines across the lake to my new base.
Made it a heck of a lot easier gather both logs and stone.
Here's a quick screenshot of me transporting logs across the lake at the earlier stages of the island base.

My base was starting to come along. I wanted a stone base floor (with a mixture of stone and wooden flooring) followed by a wood second floor with a large gabled roof.
I also wanted a balcony wrapping around part of the second floor to provide a nice scenic view for the days where I didn't want to venture out and worry about too many enemies.

My gabled roof was coming together, I had a lot of frustrations building this sections, however I also had a lot of fun. There's something about learning the physics of a game and the mix of trial and error while attempting different placements and styles that stimulates a certain part of my brain.
One thing you probably notice in the below screenshot is my trusty tent still in place...

That's it for now. I will post an update in the future of my further progress, finishing the house, where I am at with the story etc.

Thanks for reading.
